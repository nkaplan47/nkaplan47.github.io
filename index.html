    </div>
    <div class="w3-container">
		<p>Hello there! My name is Nick Kaplan and I am a 24 year old Software Engineer living in the SW suburbs of Minneapolis.</p>
		<p>In my free time you'll find me playing basketball, playing videogames, or playing with my pup Olive. <span id="oliveImg">(Don't worry I have a pic)</span></p>
		<p>I grew up in a small town in southern Minnesota called Elysian, and attended high school in the neighboring town of Waterville. There I played 
		   a bunch of sports, acted in a few plays, and met some life-long friends.</p>
		<p>After high school I decided to go to Duluth to the College Of St. Scholastica to study Computer Sciences. While at college I continued to play football and run-in
		   track. I also met my current girlfriend Nikki and met some more life-long friends.  In 2017, I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Sciences, with
		   a douple concentration in Software Engineering and Business Management.</p>
		<!--<p>For a more in depth look at my education you can navigate to the page <a href="#" onclick="document.getElementById('school').style.display='block';document.getElementById('about').style.display='none'">here</a></p>-->
		<p>Now that you know a little about my personal life, you can find more information about my job as a software engineer

      <h1>Current Work</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-container">
		<p>I am currently working at a Power Systems Software company called Open Systems International Inc., which specializes in software 
		   used to manage and optimize utility systems in all facets of the industry. 
		   (Link to company website <a href="https://www.osii.com/" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>
		<p>My work at the company varies from week to week, but a majority of work is done on the GIS(Geographic Information System) Extracts team.
		   We specialize in converting the data from our new customer into an intermediate format that can be used within our software to represent
		   their electric data model.</p>
		<p>Another application I work on is a tool called Arrow that check standards laid out by our System Engineers. The tool can be 
		   deployed to multiple remote servers(windows or linux) and perform checks ranging from running local processes, to confirming 
		   databases are correctly configured.</p>
		<p>I am also in charge of improvement and maintenance of what we called our Standards Website. It is a resource for our Project Engineers
		   to give them a central location to view standards for our systems. The website is written is cshtml and implements an MVC design.  It also
		   uses a Microsoft SQL Server to store and add data for the website.</p>
		<p>There are many other things I touch at OSI and I develop in multiple languages, so there is never a lack of variety!</p>
